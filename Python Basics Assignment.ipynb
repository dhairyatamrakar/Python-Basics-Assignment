    "# 2.Describe the role of predefined keywords in Python and provide examples of how they are used in a program.\n",

These keywords are reserved, meaning they cannot be used as identifiers (names for variables, functions, etc.) in your code. They serve as the building blocks of Python programming and are essential for writing functional and syntactically correct code.\n",
